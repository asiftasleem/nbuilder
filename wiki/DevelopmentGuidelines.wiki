  # The project has two outputs - a CLR version and a Silverlight version. All code must compile for both.
  # Every patch must have unit tests and those tests must provide 100% coverage.
  # Tests are divided into three categories:
    * Unit - the class under test is completely isolated by use of stubs or mocks.
    * Integration - classes tested together.
    * Functional - 'real life' tests and documentation.
  # Every new class must have a 'unit' test fixture at least.
  # Add integration tests when necessary to do so.
  # For new features or changes to existing features use the functional tests project for high level real world tests and to serve as simple documentation for users.
  # Any new tests must follow this naming convention:
       [http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2005/04/03/TestNamingStandards.aspx MethodName_Scenario_Expectation()]
  # Every class must have an interface and must be injected through constructor arguments.
  # Every class must have a single responsibility.
  # Every new test must be in Arrange Act Assert form. If touching an existing test in record/replay, convert it to AAA syntax unless it is too time consuming.
  # The "Foo Bar" convention is not permitted anywhere
  # American English spellings should be used not British English
